lightning - lightning shell


.SH SYNOPSIS
lightning [options] [file]


.SH DESCRIPTION

.B lightning
is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard
input or from a file.

.B Overview

The lightning is a command that reads lines for either a file or the terminal,
iterprets them, and generally executes other commands.

.B Lexical Structure

lightning reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words
at whitespace.

.B Commands

The lightning interprets the words it reads according to a language, the
specification of which is outside the scope of this man page.  Essentially
though, a line is read and if the first word of the line (or after a control
operator) is not a reserved word, then the shell has recognized a simple
command. 
Otherwise, a complex command or some other special construct may have been
recognized.
